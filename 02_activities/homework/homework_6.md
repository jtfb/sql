**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.


Reflecting on how to adjust to include ethics and inequality components, data is powerful and can shape models that influence society. When not handled carefully, these models can continue to support social inequalities, benefiting only those with more power or wealth. It’s essential to ensure transparency and involve people from diverse backgrounds such as different nationalities, social classes, genders, and religions. So we can create fairer systems. Privacy and transparency should also be a must when working with anything.

I've worked many years in the film industry, and I saw something that highlights this need for inclusion. As a color specialist, I learned that early photography didn’t properly capture darker skin tones, focusing only on white subjects. Guess why? The technology improved over time, but not because of a moral obligation to represent everyone equally. It improved because companies wanted to display different shades of CHOCOLATE in advertisements. This example shows that unless fairness and inclusivity are considered from the start, some people or groups will be left out.

We are all living in a information-driven world where data can be accessed and analyzed quickly, and from anywhere. We have the opportunity to use this on our advantage and bring diversity into every project and decision we make. It’s important to actively think about who might be affected or excluded by the data we work with, and to strive for fairness and privacy for everyone. By being conscious of these factors, we can work toward a more ethical and inclusive future for all of us. We won't be here for ever, so let's leave a better world than we found it.
